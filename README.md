# Machine-Learning-Projects
My own implementation of machine learning algorithms in Matlab 


Projetc1: Implementation of linear regression with closed form and gradient decent solutions.
Project2: Implementaion polynomial linear regression with regularization. 
Project3: Bias Variance tradeoff analysis (early stopping to prevent overfitting).
Project4_smoker: Logistic regression with k-fold cross validation applied 2D data (2 features).
Project4_skin: Logistic regression with k-fold cross validation applied 3D data (3 features).
Project5_regression: Implementation of neural network and application to regression problem.
Project5_XOR: Implementation of neural network and application to classification problem (XOR).

These are all my own implementation, if you have any questions please feel free to let me know!
